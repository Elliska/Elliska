## About Me ðŸ§¶

I'm passionate about data and love turning messy, complex processes into clean, automated pipelines. My current focus is on Data Engineering â€” designing, building, and optimizing systems that make data flow efficiently and reliably.

I enjoy learning and thrive on challenges. My strength lies in understanding data quality, transforming raw sources into reliable datasets, and making sure the right people get the right data at the right time. I believe transformation is where real insights begin â€” and thatâ€™s where I do my best work.
