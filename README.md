### About me 🧶

I have great a passion for data and analytical mind. My weaknesses lie in databases, data transformation, analyses, and the pursuit of learning new things.

> I love learning and enjoy challenges!

My interests revolve around data. Not only do I enjoy analyses, but I am also dedicated to make data accessible for anyone working with it. When analyzing data, transformation becomes inevitable. While many dislike this part, I find it fascinating. It is through this phase that I gain a real understanding of data quality, consistency, and ideas on how to enhance them.

### What I am currently learning and working on? 📗

Currently, most of my efforts are focused on improving my SQL skills and improve my proficiency in Python.
