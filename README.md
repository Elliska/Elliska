### Hi there 👋

Test repostiory with information about me. So I just want to know how this will behave. Basically it is just fancy lorem ipsum without no real information. Just something to test this text on my profile as I hope my profile will once host a lot of projects other than Excel and Power BI stuff as I am currently working on so much more.

Is it even okay to publish projects which are not done, or even in a stage of "viable minimum"? We'll see.

📍Can I add some emojis? How this will look like? Does this help with reading? Is it more fun?
