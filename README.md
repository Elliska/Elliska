### About me 🧶

I have great passion for data and analytical mind. My weakness are databases, data transformation, analyses and learning new things.

> I love learning and challenges!

My interests are data oriented. Not only I like analyses, but I am striving to make data accessible for anyone who will be working with them. When analyzing data, their transformation is inevitable. Most people dislike this part; I, on the contrary, like this part very much. Only through this phase I can get a real glimpse of data quality, consistency and ideas what can be done to make them better.

### What I am currently learning and working on? 📗

 At this moment most of my effort comes to have better SQL skill and improve python. 

 📍 trying to design and write my first app
